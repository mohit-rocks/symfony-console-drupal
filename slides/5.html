  <ul>
    <li>Single entry point for users to run command</li>
    <li>More aligned to Symfony ecosystem</li>
    <li>Various building blocks, components for the output</li>

    <ul>
      <li>First of all, let‚Äôs see why we need Console commands considering we already have Drush.</li>
      <li>The main intention is:
        <ul>
          <li>To provide a single entry point for which users can run the command</li>
          <li>More aligned to Symfony eco-system which we‚Äôve been adopting for quite some time</li>
          <li>Having another tool in the toolkit is a good thing</li>
          <li>In drupal core, we have a console app called drupal in core/scripts folder</li>
          <li>We can also convert existing drupal  application to Console commands
            <ul>
              <li>Since this application is already powered by console</li>
              <li>However, if we have something inbuilt in core, we can convert those to individual commands</li>
              <li>We can even ship commands in Drupal core itself, like Symfony does</li>
              <li>One use case can be, we can have recipe related commands that are out of the box in Drupal core itself</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
